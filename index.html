The talk concerning the creative constraints and possibilities of working with AI and Movement Mapping, got me reflecting on the concept of Asymmetry between physical and digital space.

    <br></br>
How a computer sees us and how we look at a computer become the questions to be able to manage the third dimension where these two points of view converge. Artists during the discussion expressed and showed their practice at the intersection of the human-machine dimensions. The performance of representation becomes the hologram by which axisymmetry shows itself.

    <br></br>
How do we represent this kind of relationship that exists between different dimensions of space? What are the graphic codes-what are the algorithmic codes? What is the decision-making process that leads us to decide what to map?
<br></br>
Digitizing and mapping an asymmetrical body within structured rules and codes in a linear rule system, and visualizing it through alphanumeric chains within a digital space, is the task artists set themselves while creating new models for the future. Technologists and Artists, through new tools, push the conversation about controversial contemporary topics in front of a society that is still blind when asked to imagine the space where information is gathered between us and the computer. 
This space of intermezzo has become an obsession for those people who attempt to manipulate asymmetries.
Experimenting at this intersection then becomes a game about bodies and space, a challenge to understand what the effects of movement are in a system that is not yet trained to read diversities human imperfections.
<br></br>
In the research field of Machine Learning, we teach machines to see the world as we know it by restricting them to the patterns of space we already know.
Machine learning is trained on datasets and a lot of software still recognises the body in the form of the body, neglecting parameters that are not computable.
<br></br>
What if the experimentation exercise became figuring out what patterns we do not yet know, and the challenge became teaching them to a machine that allows us to visualize and learn them in their complete system?
If the medium between the two spaces is technology, which must be taught to work, how can we make it the tool to visualize a world we do not yet know how to describe.

This is for me the definition of Asymmetry that exists between bodies and space, man and machine - physical and digital.
