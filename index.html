 The talk concerning the creative constraints and possibilities of working with AI and Movement Mapping, got me reflecting about the concept of "Asymmetry" that exists between physical and digital space. 

    <br></br>
How a comptuer sees us and how we look at a computer, become the questions to be able to manage the third dimension where these two points of view converge. Artists during the discussion expressed and showed their practice at the intersection of the human-machine dimensions.
The performance of representation becomes the hologram by which axisymmetry shows itself. 
    <br></br>
   How do we represent this kind of relationship that exists between different dimensions of space? What are the graphic codes-what are the algorithmic codes? What is the decision making process that leads us to decide what to map?
<br></br>
Digitizing and mapping an asymmetrical body within structured rules and codes, in a linear rule system, and visualizing it through alphanumeric chains within a digital space, is the task artists set themselves while creating new models for the future.
Technologists and Artits through new tools, push the conversation about controversial contemporary topics in front to a society that is still blind when asked to imagine the space where information is gathered between us and the computer.  
This space of intermezzo become an obsession for those people who
